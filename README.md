- Neovim (‚â• 0.9 recommended)
- Git
- A terminal with true color support(i use [warp](https://www.warp.dev/))
- ripgrep

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vterebenin/rnjee-nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```

1. Launch Neovim - plugins will auto-install via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
2. If nothing happens, force sync with `:Lazy sync`
3. Verify setup with `:checkhealth lazy`

### API Keys (Optional)

For AI features, add to your shell config:

```bash
export HG_API_TOKEN="your-token" # huggingface token 
export DEEPSEEK_API_TOKEN="your-token" # deepseek token
```

## Customization

This config is:
- ‚ùå Not beginner-friendly
- ‚ùå Not minimal
- ‚ùå Not well-documented
- ‚úîÔ∏è Mine

If you want to adapt it:
1. Check `lua/ternow/` for module configurations
2. Bring your own patience

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:
- AI is a paid deepseek currently, configure it yourself
- LSP not working? Run `:Mason` to install servers
- Weird behavior? It's probably a feature

## Contributing

PRs are welcome if you:
- Fix my terrible code
- Add something actually useful
- Don't break my workflow

Remember: This isn't an IDE, it's my text editor with trust issues.
