# My Neovim Configuration

This thing is my Neovim configuration! This setup is nothing, but monstrosity with custom preferences without any real direction in use. 

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Neovim (v0.5.0+ recommended)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vterebenin/new-neovim-configs ~/.config/nvim
    ```

2. Open Neovim and run the following command to install plugins using `lazy`:

    ```vim
    :Lazy
    ```

    This will automatically install and configure all the plugins specified in the configuration. (press U if nothing happened)
    Also it worth to checkhealth on Lazy, so everything is fine.

    ```vim
    :checkhealth lazy
    ```

## Plugins

I use the [lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin manager.

**List of current plugins(wip):**

- **Plugins Included:**
  - Plugin 1
  - Plugin 2
  - ...

## Customization

Customize at your own risk. I dont bother well documenting this abomination, nope, not happening.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues or have questions, well, bad for you. Figure it out yourself. Git gud, dude.
